Thank you for using my script, getting top week repositories by stars from  [gitHub](www.github.com)
and showing their open issues.
## Quick start
Download script, install requirements and run it. By default it shows 20 top 
repositories. You can change this number by changing line:  
<code>
top_size = 20
